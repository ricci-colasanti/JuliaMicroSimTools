    "## Toy data generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This code suite generates synthetic demographic datasets for testing and analysis. The `random_partition` function creates mathematically valid random partitions where numbers sum to specified totals, serving as the core engine. The `toy_census` function generates population data for geographic areas, producing category counts (like gender and age groups) that correctly sum to each area's population size. The `toy_survey` function creates individual response data where each simulated person selects single choices from multiple categories using one-hot encoding. Together, these functions output properly formatted CSV files with headers and data rows, creating ready-to-use synthetic datasets for statistical analysis, machine learning, or data visualization projects."
