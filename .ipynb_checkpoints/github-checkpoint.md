# How to Give Edit (Write) Access to a GitHub Repository

## 1. Open the repository
- Sign in to GitHub.
- Navigate to the repository where you want to add collaborators.

## 2. Go to the repository settings
- Click the **Settings** tab (top‑right of the repo page).
  

## 3. Select “Manage access”
- In the left‑hand sidebar, choose **Manage access**.
- You may be asked to confirm your password or complete two‑factor authentication.

## 4. Invite a collaborator
- Click the **Invite a collaborator** button.
- Start typing the GitHub username, full name, or email address of the person you want to add.
- Select the correct user from the dropdown list.

## 5. Set the permission level
- After selecting the user, a permission dropdown appears.
- Choose **Write** (this grants edit rights: push commits, create branches, open pull requests, etc.).
- *(Optional)* Choose **Maintain** or **Admin** for broader privileges, but **Write** is usually sufficient for editing code.

## 6. Send the invitation
- Click **Add `<username>` to this repository**.
- The invited user receives an email and a GitHub notification.
- Once they accept, they’ll have the specified access.

### Quick Checklist
- **Admin rights** are required on the repository to manage access.
- **Write permission** = edit rights (push, merge, create branches).
- **Collaborators** are added per‑repo; for organization‑wide teams, manage permissions via **Teams** under the organization’s settings instead.

### Managing Access in an Organization (optional)
If you’re part of a GitHub **Organization**, you can:
1. Create a **Team**.
2. Assign the team **Write** access to the repository.
3. Add members to that team.

This approach simplifies permission management when dealing with many collaborators.
